@article{strogatz_collective_1998,
	Abstract = {Networks of coupled dynamical systems have been used to model biological oscillators1,2,3,4, Josephson junction arrays5,6, excitable media7, neural networks8,9,10, spatial games11, genetic control networks12 and many other self-organizing systems. Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks `rewired'to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them `small-world'networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

A common property of many large networks is that the vertex connectivities follow a scale-free power-law distribution. This feature was found to be a consequence of two generic mechanisms: (i) networks expand continuously by the addition of new vertices, and (ii) new vertices attach preferentially to sites that are already well connected. A model based on these two ingredients reproduces the observed stationary scale-free distributions, which indicates that the development of large networks is governed by robust self-organizing phenomena that go beyond the particulars of the individual systems.},

 abstract = {This article examines Comenius's extensive correspondence network of which 560 sent and received letters survive. The first aim is to look closer at the letters from the early period of Comenius's life with special regard to his position within the communication network of the Unity of Brethren and to his fundraising activities. Second, it shows how Comenius's correspondence network expanded beyond the structures of the Unity and became a part of the international network of learned correspondence. It also discusses how this network was used in favor of the Unity and how it provided a new type of patronage for the Brethren. It demonstrates that Comenius's didactic and pansophic agenda was often in conflict with his ecclesiastical duties and sometimes with the efforts of his correspondence partners. Finally, the article focuses on two examples of personal correspondence networks of two important recipients of Comenius's letters: Petr Figulus and Mikuláš Drabík. Both of them were ministers of the Unity, both were close to Comenius, and their networks were built with his help but with very different purposes.},
